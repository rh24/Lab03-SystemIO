# System.IO

This is a .NET Core 2.1 console application written in C# that serves as a demonstrative knowledge of using the System.IO class library. Within the console, users can input data into a text file. They can also read from the text file, update it, and delete it entirely. The main purpose of this application is as a word guessing game.

Drawing from the words in a text file within this repository, users may play a hangman-style word guessing game. The user is prompted to guess until they win or quit. A menu will display with options for what the user may do next within the application.
